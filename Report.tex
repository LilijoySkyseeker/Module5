\chapter{Description of Project}
\section{Project Idea}
This proposal is for a home security system that is a hardware and software solution.
Our company will offer installation services for the system, which is a base station and various POE IP cameras.
The storage for the system will be through AWS and there will be a web interface to access the recorded feeds.
The monetization will be through a hardware and install fee, and a monthly subscription fee for the AWS storage and web interface.

The hardware will be based of a Raspberry Pie 5, with a Corral Accelerator, and a POE switch.
It will all be contained within a custom case that will be mounted to the wall.
The cameras will be POE IP cameras that will be connected to the switch and powered by it.
The customer will be able to pick various numbers and variations of indoor and outdoor cameras.

The Pie will be running the default version of Raspbian.
The open source software Frigate will be used to manage the cameras, feeds, recordings, and detection.
The storage will be through AWS S3 mounted locally using Rclone.
Frigate will handle the web interface, but there will be a tunnel to the AWS instance so the customer can access the recordings on the web.

The install service will be done by in house contractors.
They will visit the customer's home, advise them on number of cameras and camera placement.
They will then install the hardware, connect it to the internet, and show the customer how to use the system.


\chapter{Likely Marketing Efforts}

\chapter{Timeline and Budget}
\section{Timeline}

\section{Budget Estimates}
Cost estimates are divided into hardware, 
storage/software, licensing, human resources,
developer labor, installer labor, employee benefits, 
vehicle cost, and damage allowance.

Hardware consists of the Pi 5, costing \$150 dollars (including shipping). Cameras, 
the average customer will buy 4 1200p cameras valued at 100 dollars each. 
The Coral TPU and the M2 accelerator key cost \$100 together.
The POE switch will cost 50 dollars, and another 50 dollars for cabling, mounting equipment, etc. Calculating into 2,000 units come to ~1.5 million.

Damage Allowance is an alloted amount for recovery of damaged product that arrives, that usually equates to 10\% or total hardware cost.

Storage cost refers to the AWS storage cost for 4 cameras in 1200p, with the predetermined storage. This is estimated to be \$96,000 a year.
Software is \$0 outside of storage costs.

Licensing includes electrical contractor licenses for 3 installers, \$600. Business license, \$100. 
Home Improvement Contractor license. \$1095.

Human Resources requires one person, making 60k annually. 

Developer labor cost is determined by the teams total salaries combined, divided by how long they are needed ().

Installer labor is determined by the installers salaries times amount of installers.
