\chapter{Description of Project}
\section{Project Idea}
This proposal is for a home security system that is a hardware and software solution.
Our company will offer installation services for the system, which is a base station and various POE IP cameras.
The storage for the system will be through AWS and there will be a web interface to access the recorded feeds.
The monetization will be through a hardware and install fee, and a monthly subscription fee for the AWS storage and web interface.

The hardware will be based of a Raspberry Pie 5, with a Corral Accelerator, and a POE switch.
It will all be contained within a custom case that will be mounted to the wall.
The cameras will be POE IP cameras that will be connected to the switch and powered by it.
The customer will be able to pick various numbers and variations of indoor and outdoor cameras.

The Pie will be running the default version of Raspbian.
The open source software Frigate will be used to manage the cameras, feeds, recordings, and detection.
The storage will be through AWS S3 mounted locally using Rclone.
Frigate will handle the web interface, but there will be a tunnel to the AWS instance so the customer can access the recordings on the web.

The install service will be done by in house contractors.
They will visit the customer's home, advise them on number of cameras and camera placement.
They will then install the hardware, connect it to the internet, and show the customer how to use the system.

\chapter{Technical Details / Technical Research}
A three-tier surveillance security system package specifically designed for family homes. The packages offer different levels of security, from essential home monitoring to advanced surveillance with AI-based detection. Each package includes necessary hardware, software, and storage solutions for easy installation and use. The Coral USB Accelerator is included in all packages to enhance AI-based motion detection and object recognition. Real pricing for PoE switches has also been incorporated. Camera specifications have been adjusted so that the first tier supports either indoor or outdoor use, and the second tier includes both indoor and outdoor cameras.
Tier 1: Essential Home Package
The Essential Home Package is designed for families looking for an entry-level yet effective surveillance system. This package includes two cameras that can be used either indoors or outdoors, providing flexibility for home security.
Components:
• 2 Indoor/Outdoor PoE Cameras (Reolink 5MP, 2560x1920 resolution, 30 fps) - $70 each
• 1 Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB RAM) pre-installed with surveillance software - $60
• 1 Coral USB Accelerator for AI-powered motion detection - $25.99
• 1 PoE Switch (4-port TP-Link TL-SF1005P) - $40
Features:
• Local storage on Raspberry Pi 5 (up to 128GB via microSD)
• Mobile app access for live viewing
• AI-based motion detection and object recognition using Coral USB Accelerator
Estimated Total Cost: $266
Tier 2: Smart Home Package
This package offers additional security coverage and smart features for homeowners seeking more control over their surveillance system. It includes a combination of indoor and outdoor cameras, ensuring comprehensive security coverage.
Components:
• 2 Indoor PoE Cameras + 2 Outdoor PoE Cameras (Reolink 5MP, 2560x1920 resolution, 30 fps) - $70 each
